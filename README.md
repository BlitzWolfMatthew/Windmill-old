# Windmill
An interpreted binary executor for CosmosOS.

TODO:
- Parsing methods - only byte & int32 to string atm;
- If statements;
- Goto function;
- Memory shifting/gc;
- *Multitasking*;

Note: The current project files are made for a normal CLI C# application, but they can easily be ported over to CosmosOS.
